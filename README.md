## Themes and CSS

### WhiteBlue
This theme has a heavy emphasis on the use of white backgrounds throughout the interface for light users. Light greys and other non white colors are removed where possible. A light blue color is used as an accent for controls, headings and other areas of interest

## Margin Top
This simple CSS adds extra padding to any notes with the #cssClass=margin-top label. Useful for headings.
